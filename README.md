# ANN_Implementation

Note that please download the dataset:
train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz) 
train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz(http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz)
from MNIST (http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).
Before runing the program, these two file also should be unzipped and placed in /6205Project-ANNs

In this project, a small subsection of object recognitionâ€”digit recognition will be implemented, based on the MNIST database of handwritten digits. It includes building a neural network structure, training the model and accuracy evaluating.  
Please download and run it locally.In console you would see the change of the loss function and final predication accuracy. For now the best result we got is 988/1000. Feel free to modify the parameter and find a beeter match.
